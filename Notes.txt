Our plan is to have a temp folder that you move the original file into where it is renamed, then that file is moved into
a clone of assets with only the folders in it.

Ignored files will not be moved over at all since minecraft automatically uses default textures for missing files in a
texture pack

Rick-roll everyone who reaches the ending credits heheheha

Change the splash text to say who the randomizer is created by

Make the user drag and drop their own assets folder

Make a separate folder for copying in files (Like the pack.mcmeta, pack.png, end.txt, etc.)
